# Overview

The UK Biobank (UKB) is a large prospective cohort of more than 500,000 middle-aged and elderly British men and women. The UKB has quite liberal access policies and is available to any "bona fide" researcher for health-related studies. The UKB subjects were deeply phenotyped and genotyped with various follow-up assessments underway, including a death registry and the collection of medical records from the NHS. Some phenotypes were only collected on subsets of the sample (MRI scans or retinal imaging, for example).

## Our Obligations

* Annual progress report for each project.^[https://bit.ly/2TNcLPb]
* Return of results to the UKB within six months of publication of twelve months of the end of the project.^[https://bit.ly/2SDD7qu] This includes:
    + Derived variables and a description of how they were generated
    + Scripts
    + A copy of the final manuscript
    + A paragraph summarizing the results, to be shared with participants
* If a publication or presentation is "likely to provoke controversy or attract significant public attention," inform the UKB at least two weeks in advance.
* Acknowledge that "this research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource" in any presentation or publication and include the project ID number.
